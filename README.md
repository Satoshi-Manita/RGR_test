# RGR test
Device that allows mice to perform reaching, grasping, and retrieving movements during head fixation. Agar cubes were presented as target objects in front of water-restricted mice, and the mice were able to reach, grasp, and retrieve them with their forelimb. The agar cubes were supplied by a custom-made automatic dispenser, which uses a microcontroller to control the two motors to push out the agar cubes.
